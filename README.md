# Machine Learning Assignment

For this assignment, you will participate in groups of 4 students in a learning challenge. You will need to submit your predictions and a report describing your methods and results and the code you used to generate the predictions.
The assignment is worth 30% of your grade.
The assignment grade will be based on the quality of your work as judged by the instructor based on your report and code.
Alongside this assignment description a tabular data set will be provided where the target variable is named ”transaction”. You will be using the other columns for learning the function that maps them to the transaction.

## Binary Classification Task

In this assignment, you are asked to perform a binary classification task. You need to start with reserving 20% of the data for testing purposes.
You will be training 3 models of your choice and comparing their performances. You can choose any two models (Neural Networks, logistic regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor, etc) for comparison. You will split your training data into training and validation sets to train your models and find the optimal parameters, respectively. You will test the performance of the three models on the same test dataset that you reserved.
You will use:
- training part to train your model,
- validation part to find the optimal parameters of your model,
- test part to evaluate the model with the optimal parameters found on the validation set.
